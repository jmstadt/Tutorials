    "[Tangram Flex](https://www.tangramflex.com) produces a specification language called \"Flex\".  Flex allows you to define interface standards/interface control documents (ICDs) that can directly be linked to code.  In addtion, Flex allows you to define transforms between different types of interfaces and these transforms are also linked to code. This code is typically used in embedded systems to provide messaging apis between software components.  You can read about the benefits of Flex [here](https://assets.website-files.com/5f203955af96993dab25b732/622f4f4b5271725653b903ae_WhyFlex_PublicWhitepaperv1.pdf) "

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "An important feature of Flex is the ability to define and leverage **contextual transforms**.  Contextual transforms are transforms between different types of interfaces where there is a \"context\" at play.  The context is data that does not come from either of the interfaces but that is relevant for the transform.  Contexts can take a variety of forms but this toy project will need a concept of time.  As you will see below, a time in days is needed to execute the transform and that time does not come from either of the interfaces.  Dealing with these types of contexts can be problematic in mission critical systems in that the context can introduce side effects that can cause indeterminate or unexpected behavior.  For a brief illustration of the potential problems that side effects cause see this blog [Code Smell: Side Effect](https://medium.com/thinkster-io/code-smell-side-effects-caf799df2151).  Flex deals with these types of side effects in a controlled way and while this toy is not a mission critical system, Flex's ability in this regard is leveraged."

And we can author the contextual transform between the position reports and the assignment with the context of how many days it has been since the last check of the battery water. We can generate code for this design that the position report component and the battery water check component can leverage.  \n",

The components and transformed are modeled with definitions that can be shared.  In addition, either the LIfe360 or Gmail can be easily swapped out and the transform and interfaces are still applicable.  You essentially created a modular open system architecture.  In addition, you used the structure of Flex to deal with a needed side effect (i.e. the Days Since Last Check).  This allows you to handle the side effect in a trusted way."
