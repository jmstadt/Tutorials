    " - Allow custom operations that are not or not yet implemented in the 3D UI\n",

    "- As people who work in Python know, there are many ways to work in Python.  Maybe people (including Lucd developers) use PyCharm.  Others use VIM or other IDEs.  What environment you choose is your decision.  These notes are geared toward Anaconda3 and Jupyter Notebooks.  But, that is not a requirement.\n",

The Lucd platform leverages Python 3.6, so in order to ensure your work is compatible, your environment should run Python 3.6.  If you are starting from scratch with a fresh Anaconda install, the following Anaconda executable installs Python 3.6.5 as your base environment, windows 64 bit https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Windows-x86_64.exe.  For Mac or Linux or 32 bit reference the appropriate Anaconda3 from:  https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/. But, you can definitely install the most recent Anaconda executable (with Python 3.7) and create your own 3.6.5 environment. And, again, using Anaconda is not a requirement, you can use PyCharm, other IDEs, or compatible Python environments if you prefer.  \n",
