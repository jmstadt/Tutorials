    "This tutorial demonstrates the steps required to train an AI model on data leveraging the Lucd Data Science Platform.  The tutorial is a toy, leveraging the IRIS dataset, designed to show the basic steps to train a model.  In the example a Virtual Data Set is created, A custom operation adds a categorical feature to the existing continuous features.  Then a custom Pytorch model is developed and trained in the platform.  Both the Lucd 3D UI and the Lucd Python Client are leveraged during the tutorial.  The tutorial is brokein up into three Parts:\n",
    "1. __Part 1: Creating a Virtual Data Set (VDS)__\n",
    "2. Part 2: Performing a Custom Operation during Exploratory Data Analysis:  https://github.com/jmstadt/Tutorials/blob/master/Lucd_Part_2_of_3_Data_Science_Tutorial.ipynb\n",
